      Anticipation mounts in greatest cycling nation in the world for world’s
      greatest cycling race Cycle paths have been painted yellow, knitting
      enthusiasts have made a giant yellow jersey, and preparations are being
      made for a flotilla of boats flying yellow flags. The “big yellow party”
      comes to Denmark on 1 July when the country widely regarded as the best in
      the world for cyclists hosts the opening stage of the world’s greatest
      cycling race. The Tour de France was originally slated to start in
      Copenhagen in 2021, but was transferred to Brest in response to a
      Covid-related scheduling conflict with the European Championships.
      Postponing the Grand Départ Copenhagen by a year has been welcomed as
      allowing more time for planning and now, post Covid lockdowns, organisers
      are hoping their investment of 150m Danish krone (about £17.3m) will boost
      tourism. “There is a lot of excitement in the city,” said Sophie Hæstorp
      Andersen, a cycling fan and lord mayor of Copenhagen, where a huge clock
      in the city’s main square is counting down to 1 July. “We’re gearing up
      for a big yellow party where everyone’s invited,” said Andersen. King
      Christian X’s bridge in Soenderborg, Denmark, covered with yellow fabric
      ahead of the start of the 2022 Tour de France cycling race. Denmark’s
      reputation as a cycling nirvana is well-earned. There are approximately
      7,500 miles of bike routes and bike lanes across the country and half of
      all Copenhageners commute by bike.

      Cycling enthusiasts in Copenhagen can try out the Tour de France route
      themselves on 2 July, when the professionals set off for stage two from
      Roskilde Cathedral, where the Viking king Harald Bluetooth is said to be
      buried. After a windswept sprint across the Great Belt Bridge, the route
      finishes in Nyborg on the island of Funen. The third and last Danish stage
      on 3 July starts in the city of Vejle – known as The Kingdom of Cycling
      thanks to its Alpine-grade ascents shaped by the ice age in an otherwise
      remarkably flat country. The Grand Depart Trophy of the Tour de France
      cycling race and different jerseys are on display at an exhibition inside
      the Danish Industry Building in Copenhagen, Denmark The route will take in
      Vejle’s harbour, with buildings designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson, as
      well as the Unesco world heritage site at Jelling, where Bluetooth raised
      the Jelling Stone in 965 CE, marking the unification of Denmark as a
      Christian nation. Cyclists will pass through Kolding, celebrated for its
      750-year-old royal fortress Koldinghus, as well as another Unesco world
      heritage site at Christiansfeld before finishing 113 miles later in
      Sønderborg. A total of 5,000 volunteers will be involved in keeping the
      festivities going countrywide, but Vejle municipality has taken an
      interesting approach to building engagement. “We wanted the community to
      feel ownership of the event instead of just commissioning projects,” said
      organiser Jacob Rasmussen, “so we set up a 3m Danish krone grant fund for
      innovative projects that celebrate cycling”. Tour de France Vejle is
      headed up by an unassuming man in shorts named Lars Ulrich – a
      physiotherapist and bike enthusiast who has spent his entire life
      explaining that he is not the drummer from Metallica. Ulrich was tasked
      with getting non-cyclists excited about the race. “I thought, ‘how can I
      make this an historic event? How can I get it to be remembered for
      anything other than tight Lycra pants?’ Covid separated us for so long
      that Tour de France is an opportunity to come together – I want everyone
      involved.” Residents of local hospices and care homes used 9,000 balls of
      wool to knit a giant 600kg yellow jersey to be raised up at the harbour.
      Alex Slot Hansen, an employee at Sydbank, invested in 9,000 balls of wool
      for the residents of local hospices and care homes to knit a giant 600kg
      yellow jersey to be raised up at the harbour. “I had a lot of messages
      from carers who say it’s been therapeutic for hospice patients in
      particular,” said Hansen. Morten Teilmann-Jørgensen from the Viking Kings
      experience centre came up with “the Viking Biking Escape Box”. “You get in
      a box on a stationary bike and you see yourself on a screen,” said
      Teilmann-Jørgensen. “There are virtual ‘Vikings’ behind you, and when you
      start cycling, they start chasing.” The Viking Escape Box Restaurateurs
      and retailers are bracing themselves for the city to double in size, with
      100,000 visitors from around the world expected. Ulrich and his team have
      been emphasising the importance of hospitality to local businesses and how
      to be a good host – something that doesn’t necessarily come naturally in a
      country not famed for its service culture. Sign up to First Edition, our
      free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am Maria Theresa Olsen
      from Bryg coffee house in Vejle hopes to confound expectations. “I’m
      trying to think, ‘if I were a tourist what would I want?’ and ‘how can I
      give a good impression of this town I’m proud to call home?’’ she said.
      “The eyes of the world will be on us, so we want to give as good as
      experience as we can.” The one element of the experience no one can plan
      for is the weather and Denmark’s unpredictable summers make counting on
      sunshine futile. “I’m checking the forecast daily and crossing my
      fingers,’ said Hæstorp Andersen, “but it’ll be what it’ll be”. Ulrich
      takes a more upbeat approach: ‘It’s like we always say in Denmark:
      ‘There’s no such thing as bad weather – just the wrong clothes’.’
